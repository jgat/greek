<h1>Greek Translation Quiz</h1>

<h2>About</h2>

<div>
<p>Currently calibrated up to (and including) lesson <strong>36</strong>.</p>

<p>
This is a little project I made for learning New Testament Greek, meant to
mimic some of the questions set in class. I've selected a number of verses
which should be (mostly) translatable; this webpage picks one at random, and
asks for some of the parsing and then asks for a translation.
</p>

<p>If it's broken or you have ideas for how it could be better, get in touch.
</p>

<p><strong>Notes/Caveats</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Verses are taken from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editio_Octava_Critica_Maior">Tischendorf's
8th edition</a> of the Greek New Testament, published in the late 19th century.
It can differ slightly from modern editions (e.g. Luke 6:5 has an extra
<span class="greek">"καὶ"</span>, and Mark 1:1 is missing <span class="greek">"υἱοῦ
θεοῦ"</span>). If you're not sure, look up the verse in your UBS5.
</li>

<li>Some parsing might be ambiguous because I've pulled a single verse out of
context (e.g. <span class="greek">αὐτοῦ</span> without context might be either
masculine or neuter).</li>

<li>There might be some words which are not in the assigned vocab, but you can
probably guess what they mean. I've mostly done this for names of people and
places (e.g. <span class="greek">Μαρία</span> is "Mary").</li>

<li>There might be some words which don't fit into the paradigms we've been
taught (e.g. <span class="greek">ἤγειρα</span> is the aorist of
<span class="greek">ἐγείρω</span>, but the stem isn't what you'd expect).
I don't have a way to detect that we haven't learned this.</li>

<li>There are some verses that are fairly uninteresting to translate, like
<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-18.htm">lists of names</a> or
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-30.htm">really short verses</a>.
They show up because they meet the criteria of "possible to translate"; just
reload until you get a more interesting verse.</li>

<li>For some verbs in the middle and passive voices, my source data doesn't
distinguish between middle and passive, so the website's answer is "middle or
passive". Your answer should be only one of middle/passive, not both.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>How did you make this?</strong></p>

<p>I started with an existing set of
<a href="https://github.com/morphgnt/tischendorf-data/tree/master/word-per-line/2.8">morphology data</a>
for every word in the Tischendorf Greek New Testament, and matched that against
both the assigned vocab list for our course (which is helpfully already in a
clean spreadsheet format), and the lesson plan for different word forms (to
account for the fact that, for example, we learn the present active indicative
of verbs long before we learn the aorist passive participle of those same
verbs). I can use that to compute, for each word in the GNT, which lesson number
that word becomes accessible to learn (or that the word is not learned in this
course).</p>

<p>I can then group words together into verses, and pick out verses where, for
every word in that verse, the word's "lesson number" is less than some set
number (I use the lesson we are currently up to). I can also include verses
where all but one word matches this criterion, to get a set of verses which are
"mostly translatable", except for that one word.</p>

<p>I put all of those "mostly translatable" verses into
<a href="https://github.com/jgat/greek/blob/gh-pages/verses.js">this javascript file</a>,
and built this little website around it. The site picks one verse at random,
then picks 5 random questions about words' case/gender/number/person/tense/mood/voice.</p>

<p>At no point does this site check your answers or save your answers or
anything.</p>

<p>All up, this took me about a weekend to make. A lot of that was because I'd
forgotten how to do HTML and CSS properly.</p>
